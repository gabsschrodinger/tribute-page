          <h3>Here are some of Dazai's major works:</h3>
      
          <div class="book-list"><img id="book1" class="book-cover" src="https://books.google.com/books/content/images/frontcover/9jhi2bY3GkAC?fife=w200-h300" alt="No Longer Human's cover"><p class="about-books"><strong>No Longer Human (1973):</strong> The poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas. Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human narrates a seemingly normal life even while he feels himself incapable of understanding human beings. Oba Yozo's attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a "clown" to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection and tenderness.<a class="references" href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Osamu_Dazai_No_Longer_Human?id=9jhi2bY3GkAC" target="_blank"><sup>[Google Books]</sup></a></p></div>

Set in the early postwar years, it probes the destructive effects of war and the transition from a feudal Japan to an industrial society. Ozamu Dazai died, a suicide, in 1948. But the influence of his book has made "people of the setting sun" a permanent part of the Japanese language, and his heroine, Kazuko, a young aristocrat who deliberately abandons her class, a symbol of the anomie which pervades so much of the modern world.<a class="references" href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Osamu_Dazai_The_Setting_Sun?id=tYLyAwAAQBAJ" target="_blank"><sup>[Google Books]</sup></a></p></div>
